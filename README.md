# Portfolio

**Desktop:** ![Homepage Desktop](public/images/portfolio-desktop.jpg)

This is my personal portfolio website to showcase my projects, skills and experiences as a front-end developer.

## Description

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) portfolio website created to showcase my work, skills, and background as a front-end developer. But also focuses on my background in visual communication and graphic design. The portfolio highlights selected projects (more will be added later) and demonstrates my approach to building responsive, user-focused, and visually consistent web experiences.

- **Home** – Introduction to who I am and what I do as a front-end developer. This page also includes projects and contact section.
- **Projects** – Projects with title, descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos and GitHub repositories.
- **About** – Overview of my educations and work experiences.
- **Contact** – A contact form allowing visitors to get in touch. It also has social media and email linked.
